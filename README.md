# Project Description: Project 1 - DevOps - Functional Mini-Lab Environment Verification

This project verifies the setup of a functional mini-lab environment for the term. It involves creating a GitHub repository, setting up and configuring FreeBSD and Ubuntu virtual machines, and documenting the process. Tasks include taking screenshots of network configurations, configuring a bastion or jump host, and ensuring the environment is ready for future assignments. The completed documentation and configurations are submitted via the GitHub repository.
